# Open Challenges & Discussion Points

This document outlines key strategic challenges and open questions regarding the AI Delivery Framework. The goal is to foster discussion and collaborative refinement of the framework's design and implementation. We encourage contributors to engage with these points, perhaps by opening GitHub Issues or Discussions related to specific items.

## 1. Overhead vs. Benefit

**Challenge:** Does the framework introduce excessive process overhead (maintaining `codebase_guide.md`, scope docs, context wrappers) that outweighs the benefits of structured AI use?

**Discussion Points:**
- How can we streamline the maintenance of governance artifacts, especially the `codebase_guide.md`, to keep it truly 'live' without excessive burden?
- What are the most critical pieces of information needed in the guide and scope docs versus nice-to-haves?
- Can automation assist in keeping documentation synchronized with AI-generated/modified code?
- How do we quantify the benefits (e.g., reduced rework, better consistency, improved compliance) to justify the overhead?

## 2. Developer Buy-In

**Challenge:** How can we ensure developers perceive the framework as an enabler rather than a bureaucratic obstacle, especially when they are eager to leverage AI for speed?

**Discussion Points:**
- What tangible value propositions resonate most strongly with developers (e.g., clearer requirements, reduced cognitive load, faster integration)?
- How can the framework be introduced progressively to avoid overwhelming teams?
- What feedback mechanisms can we use to ensure the framework adapts to developers' needs and workflows?
- Can we showcase clear examples where the framework directly led to better/faster outcomes *because* of the structure?

## 3. Complexity Management

**Challenge:** Is the interplay between the Codebase Guide, Scope Docs, Delivery Tiers, and Context Wrappers sufficiently clear and well-defined to prevent ambiguity or inconsistent application?

**Discussion Points:**
- Are the definitions and boundaries of each core component clear enough?
- Where are the potential points of confusion or ambiguity in the workflow?
- How can we simplify the core concepts without sacrificing necessary rigor?
- Would visual diagrams or more detailed examples help clarify the interactions?

## 4. Effectiveness of Context Wrappers

**Challenge:** How effective can the Context Wrappers realistically be? Can they enforce deep architectural principles, or are they limited to surface-level style and guidance? How do we prevent them from becoming too generic or too brittle?

**Discussion Points:**
- What *types* of rules and guidance are most suitable for inclusion in context wrappers?
- How can wrappers be designed to be adaptable to evolving codebases and AI capabilities?
- What is the maintenance cost associated with keeping wrappers relevant?
- Can we define different *levels* of wrapper enforcement based on Delivery Tiers?

## 5. Quality of AI Output ("Garbage In, Garbage Out")

**Challenge:** The framework structures the *process* but doesn't inherently improve the AI's raw output quality. How do we address the risk of generating mediocre code, even within a well-defined process?

**Discussion Points:**
- Does the framework adequately emphasize prompt engineering best practices within the wrappers?
- How should review processes be adapted for AI-generated code within this framework?
- Should the framework include guidance on selecting appropriate AI models for different tasks?
- Can the framework incorporate automated quality checks specifically targeting common AI generation issues?

---

## 6. Risk of Rigidity

**Challenge:** How do we balance the need for discipline and structure with the agility and rapid prototyping benefits that AI offers?

**Discussion Points:**
- Are the Delivery Tiers flexible enough to accommodate different project needs (e.g., experimental spikes vs. production features)?
- Where should the framework allow for deviations or exceptions, and how should they be managed?
- How can we ensure the framework encourages responsible experimentation?

## 7. Measurement and Success Metrics

**Challenge:** How do we effectively measure the success and impact of implementing the AI Delivery Framework?

**Discussion Points:**
- What are the key indicators of success (e.g., lead time, change failure rate, maintainability scores, developer satisfaction, compliance adherence)?
- How can these metrics be tracked practicaly?
- Should different metrics be prioritized based on Delivery Tiers?
- How do we establish a baseline for comparison?
