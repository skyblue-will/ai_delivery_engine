# Learn As You Build Prompt

## Purpose and Importance

This prompt helps you understand unfamiliar technologies, concepts, or patterns encountered during development with the AI Product Delivery Engine. Rather than blindly implementing suggestions, use this to build real expertise.

**Why This Matters:**
- **Genuine Understanding**: Building with AI shouldn't mean blindly accepting code you don't understand.
- **Technical Growth**: Each build becomes a learning opportunity, not just a delivery exercise.
- **Better Decision-Making**: Understanding technologies helps you know when to trust AI suggestions and when to question them.
- **Long-term Efficiency**: Knowledge compounds, making future projects faster and more effective.
- **Risk Reduction**: Understanding what you're building reduces security and maintenance risks.

## üîß Task  
Get a clear, concise explanation of a technology, pattern, or concept you're encountering in your build process.

## üß≠ Usage Format  
Replace placeholders with your specific needs:

```
/learn_as_you_build

TECHNOLOGY: [Technology, library, pattern, or concept you're unfamiliar with]

CONTEXT: [How it's being used in your current build/where you encountered it]

EXPERIENCE_LEVEL: [Your current experience level with this or related technologies]

SPECIFIC_QUESTIONS: [Optional: Any specific aspects you need clarified]
```

## üóÇÔ∏è Expected Response

The response will provide:

1. **Concise Explanation** ‚Äì What it is in clear, jargon-free terms
2. **Key Concepts** ‚Äì The fundamental ideas you need to understand
3. **Usage Patterns** ‚Äì How it's typically implemented
4. **Benefits & Tradeoffs** ‚Äì Why it might be used and potential drawbacks
5. **Practical Example** ‚Äì A simple, concrete example in context
6. **Related Concepts** ‚Äì How it connects to things you might already know
7. **Learning Resources** ‚Äì Where to learn more (documentation, tutorials)

## üîé Best Practices

- Be specific about your prior knowledge to get appropriately detailed explanations
- Ask follow-up questions if something isn't clear
- Apply what you learn immediately in your current build
- Consider keeping a personal "tech dictionary" for future reference
- Use this as a starting point, not a replacement for deeper learning

## Example Usage

```
/learn_as_you_build

TECHNOLOGY: GraphQL

CONTEXT: Our codebase uses GraphQL for the API layer, but I've only worked with REST APIs before.

EXPERIENCE_LEVEL: Experienced with REST APIs, complete beginner with GraphQL.

SPECIFIC_QUESTIONS: 
- How does the data fetching differ from REST?
- What are the security considerations?
- Is this a good choice for our project?
```

Remember: This isn't a shortcut to avoid learning‚Äîit's a tool to help you learn more effectively as you build. The AI Product Delivery Engine believes in responsible AI use that enhances human expertise rather than replacing it.
