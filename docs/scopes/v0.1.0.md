# Version 0.1.0 Scope Document

**Status:** Planned

This document details the specific goals and deliverables for version 0.1.0 of the AI Product Delivery Engine, aligning with the initial release phase outlined in the main `roadmap.md`.

## Goals for v0.1.0

The primary objective of this version is to establish a stable, foundational engine ready for initial testing and adoption by early users.

| Goal              | Target State                                  | Benefit                               | Acceptance Criteria                                                                 |
|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Core Engine**| Stable foundation                             | Engine ready for early testing     | Core directories (`core/`, `docs/`, `meta/`, `tools/`, `scripts/`) are populated with baseline files. Key governance files (`codebase_guide.md`, `scope_doc_template.md`) exist and are usable. |
| **Documentation** | Essential guides complete                     | Clear pathway for adoption            | `docs/introduction.md`, `docs/delivery_tiers.md` provide sufficient detail for a user to understand the engine's purpose, concepts, and tiers. |
| **Delivery Tiers**| Tiers 0-5 defined and initial implementation | Structured approach to governance     | `core/context_wrappers/` contains placeholder or initial templates for tiers 0 through 5, demonstrating the tiered structure. |

## Deliverables

-   Populated core directory structures.
-   Initial versions of key governance documents (`codebase_guide.md`, `scope_doc_template.md`).
-   Essential user documentation (`introduction.md`, `delivery_tiers.md`).
-   Placeholder context wrappers for tiers 0-5.
-   Basic `README.md` and `CONTRIBUTING.md`.

## Non-Goals for v0.1.0

-   Advanced context wrapper features.
-   Specific AI model recommendations.
-   Automated compliance checks or CI/CD integration.
-   Detailed tooling landscape analysis.

## Dependencies

-   None for initial structure setup.

## Risks

-   Initial documentation may lack clarity or depth for some users.
-   Baseline templates might require significant refinement based on early feedback.
