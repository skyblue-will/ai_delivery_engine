# Theory of Operation

## Genesis & Philosophy

The AI Delivery Framework emerged in response to a critical challenge in modern software development: how to harness the extraordinary speed of AI-assisted development without sacrificing engineering discipline, governance, and compliance.

The framework was built on the fundamental observation that many AI-generated codebases suffer from similar problems:
- Lack of clear structure and documentation
- Poor testing coverage and verification
- Inconsistent compliance with regulatory requirements
- Difficulty scaling beyond the initial implementation

Rather than constrain AI's generative capabilities, the framework provides a structured container that guides AI generation toward maintainable, professional, and compliant results.

## Core Mechanisms

### The Governance Triangle

The framework operates through three integrated governance mechanisms:

1. **Codebase Guide (As-Is)** - Provides an always-accurate reference to the current state of the system, allowing new team members and AI tools to comprehend existing code.

2. **Scope Documents (To-Be)** - Codifies the specific changes planned for each version, with clear acceptance criteria and traceability to business requirements.

3. **Context Wrappers (Rules)** - Enforces appropriate engineering discipline on AI-generated code based on the project's delivery tier, ensuring standards match the project's maturity.

Together, these three mechanisms form a "governance triangle" that keeps AI-assisted development predictable, auditable, and scalable.

## Progressive Rigor Model

A key innovation of the framework is its progressive rigor model, which recognizes that engineering standards should scale with project maturity. Early prototypes need minimal structure, while production systems require comprehensive governance.

This approach prevents over-engineering early-stage projects while ensuring mature systems meet necessary standards. It provides a clear roadmap for how engineering practices should evolve as projects mature.

## Implementation Strategy

The framework is designed to be tool and model agnostic. It works with:
- Any AI coding model or assistant
- Any development toolchain
- Any programming language
- Any cloud or on-premises infrastructure

This flexibility ensures teams can adopt the framework incrementally, first applying it to the most critical governance areas and expanding coverage as the project matures.
