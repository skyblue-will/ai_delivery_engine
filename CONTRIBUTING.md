# Contributing to AI Product Delivery Engine

This document outlines how to effectively contribute to the engine.

---

## **Principles**

- Thoughtful refinement over reckless changes.
- Structured, scoped contributions over ad-hoc ideas.
- Respect for the overall goal: building professional, scalable, AI-assisted software delivery practices.

---

## **How to Contribute**

- Suggest improvements to the engine's structure, clarity, or delivery process.
- Propose refinements to documentation, workflows, or compliance models.
- Recommend new tools, templates, or practices that align with the engine principles.
- Identify areas where the engine can better serve real-world delivery needs.

---

## **Contribution Process**

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a feature branch if proposing structured changes.
3. Keep improvements scoped and modular.
4. Clearly describe the reasoning behind your suggestion or change.
5. Submit a pull request with a clear explanation.
6. Apply the appropriate [Delivery Tier](docs/delivery_tiers.md) to determine the depth of review required for your contribution.
7. Update the [Codebase Guide](meta/codebase_guide_template.md) if your change affects the repository structure.

---

## **Focus Areas for Contribution**

- Improving clarity and usability of engine documentation.
- Suggesting new modular compliance options.
- Proposing tool integrations that remain vendor-neutral.
- Enhancing example projects to show real-world usage.

### **Pilot Project Contributions**

If your team runs a delivery using the engine, consider contributing:

1. A **Scope Document** that defined the work.
2. The resulting **Codebase Guide** delta.
3. A short **Case Study** (metrics table + lessons learned) under `docs/scopes/`.
4. Any automation scripts or CI checks you built to enforce Delivery Tier rules.

These real-world artefacts are the fastest way to move the engine from theory to proven practice.
