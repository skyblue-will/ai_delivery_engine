# **AI Delivery Framework**

**Building software with AI â€”  
with structure, discipline, and scalability.**

---

## **Overview**

The AI Delivery Framework is a structured system for building real-world software products using AI-assisted development â€” without sacrificing engineering discipline, scalability, or maintainability.

It provides a complete workflow for scoped, modular, and testable delivery, ensuring that AI accelerates software development without introducing chaos or technical debt.

This framework is open to anyone who wants to combine AI-driven speed with professional-grade software engineering standards.

---

## **Core Principles**

- **Scope Before Code**  
  Every project or feature begins with a versioned, clearly defined scope document.

- **Modular and Testable Code**  
  AI-generated code must be scoped, modular, and delivered alongside tests.

- **Environment Discipline**  
  Docker-based development environments and CI/CD pipelines are mandated from early stages.

- **Adaptive Rigor**  
  Engineering standards scale with project maturity, managed via clearly defined Delivery Tiers.

- **Tool and Model Agnostic**  
  The framework works with any AI model (e.g., GPT-4, Claude, local LLMs) and tech stack.

- **Compliance When Needed**  
  Regulatory and policy compliance modules (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA) are added only when required by project type, stage, or geography.

---

## **Framework Workflow**

1. **Project Initialization**  
   Set risk profile and assign a Delivery Tier.

2. **Scoping**  
   Write versioned, actionable scope documents.

3. **Model Selection**  
   Choose appropriate AI model(s) based on task and delivery needs.

4. **Prompt Structuring**  
   Break work into modular, testable prompts.

5. **Testing & Validation**  
   Apply appropriate testing rigor based on Delivery Tier.

6. **Environment Management**  
   Enforce Docker-based environments and automated deployment pipelines.

7. **Controlled Scaling**  
   Increase delivery standards progressively as the project matures.

8. **Governance and Evolution**  
   Regularly review tools, models, and standards to stay current.

## **Delivery Tiers**

| Tier | Best For | Engineering Discipline |
|:-----|:---------|:------------------------|
| **Tier 1: Prototype** | Discovery, internal proofs of concept | Minimal |
| **Tier 2: MVP** | Internal tools, first external pilots | Moderate (+ GDPR Lite if handling personal data) |
| **Tier 3: Beta** | Public releases, scaling pilots | High |
| **Tier 4: Production** | Fully launched products | Full |
| **Tier 5: Enterprise** | High-compliance, high-security deployments | Maximum |

---

## **Adaptability to Policies and Regulations**

The AI Delivery Framework is modular and adaptable, allowing teams to bolt on compliance modules as needed â€” like choosing options when buying appliances.

- **GDPR Lite** (basic user data protection) must be considered **from MVP stage onwards** if personal data is collected.
- Full regulatory compliance (e.g., GDPR Full, HIPAA, SOC2) is applied only when project type, stage, or geography demands it.
- Internal company standards (secure coding, CI/CD, cloud policies) are layered in at the appropriate Delivery Tier.

This ensures that early-stage projects stay fast and flexible while production-grade systems remain compliant and auditable.

## **Future Refinements**

Framework development is ongoing, driven by real-world use and needs.

Planned areas for refinement include:
- **Fine-Tuned Agents**  
  Lightweight AI agents to assist in scoping, Delivery Tier assignment, and model selection.

- **AI-Promoted Scoping Tools**  
  Interactive Q&A-based scoping tools to accelerate and standardise project setup.

- **Enhanced Delivery Tiers**  
  Further maturity models for scaling from startup to enterprise.

- **Compliance Modules Expansion**  
  Predefined templates for GDPR, HIPAA, PCI-DSS, and SOC2 to reduce integration friction.

The framework is committed to continuous improvement â€” not static doctrine.
