# Roadmap

## Introduction: A Living Engine

The AI Delivery Engine provides a lightweight, binary-compliant workflow for shipping AI-powered software. Real-world use will:
- Refine governance templates and context wrappers.
- Evolve verification tools and CI checks.
- Fill gaps through pilot projects and community feedback.

This roadmap will adapt based on user insights.
