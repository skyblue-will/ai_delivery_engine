# Roadmap

This document outlines the planned evolution of the AI Delivery Framework using semantic versioning principles.

## Introduction: A Living Framework

The AI Delivery Framework is intentionally designed as a starting point, not a finished product. As teams apply this framework to build increasingly complex software projects, we expect to:

- Refine the governance mechanisms based on real-world feedback
- Adapt best practices as AI capabilities evolve
- Address gaps identified through practical application
- Scale the framework to handle more diverse project types

**This roadmap represents our current vision, but will itself evolve based on the insights gained through road testing the framework in real projects.** We encourage users to share their experiences, challenges, and successes to help improve future iterations.

## 0.3.x (Current)

| Goal | Current State | Target State | Benefit |
|------|--------------|--------------|---------|
| **Governance Core** | Basic templates | Enhanced templates with traceability | Better planning and accountability |
| **Documentation** | Scattered references | Focused, essential guides | Faster onboarding |
| **Delivery Tiers** | Tiers 1-5 | Expanded tier spectrum (0-5) | Support for a wider range of project stages |

## 0.4.x (Next)

| Goal | Current State | Target State | Benefit |
|------|--------------|--------------|---------|
| **Compliance** | Referenced but unstructured | Formal GDPR/HIPAA modules | Actionable regulatory integration |
| **CI/CD** | Basic Markdown validation | Framework compliance checks | Automatic governance enforcement |
| **Context Generation** | Manual wrapper selection | Interactive tier selection tools | Reduced friction in adoption |

## 1.0.x (Production)

| Goal | Current State | Target State | Benefit |
|------|--------------|--------------|---------|
| **Enterprise** | Individual focus | Enterprise integration patterns | Potential for large organization adoption |
| **Analytics** | No measurement | Governance impact metrics | Framework effectiveness measurements |
| **AI Agents** | Manual process | Agent-assisted governance | Reduced management overhead |

Updates tracked via versioned scope documents and governed by the framework's own processes.
