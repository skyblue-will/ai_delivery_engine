# Roadmap

This document outlines the planned evolution of the AI Delivery Framework using semantic versioning principles.

## Introduction: A Living Framework

The AI Delivery Framework is intentionally designed as a starting point, not a finished product. As teams apply this framework to build increasingly complex software projects, we expect to:

- Refine the governance mechanisms based on real-world feedback
- Adapt best practices as AI capabilities evolve
- Address gaps identified through practical application
- Scale the framework to handle more diverse project types

**This roadmap represents our current vision, but will itself evolve based on the insights gained through road testing the framework in real projects.** We encourage users to share their experiences, challenges, and successes to help improve future iterations.

## 0.1.x (Initial Release)

| Goal | Current State | Target State | Benefit |
|------|--------------|--------------|---------|
| **Core Framework** | Pre-release | Stable foundation | Framework ready for early testing |
| **Documentation** | In development | Essential guides complete | Clear pathway for adoption |
| **Delivery Tiers** | Tiers 0-5 defined | Initial implementation | Structured approach to governance |

## 0.2.x (Enhancement)

| Goal | Current State | Target State | Benefit |
|------|--------------|--------------|---------|
| **Best Models** | Not defined | Model recommendations for each activity type | Optimal tool selection for different tasks |
| **Q&A Tooling** | None | Scoping assistance tools | Help determining business requirements and delivery tier |
| **Context Wrappers** | Basic templates | Enhanced wrappers with better guidance | Improved AI interactions |

## 0.3.x (Maturity)

| Goal | Current State | Target State | Benefit |
|------|--------------|--------------|---------|
| **Governance Core** | Basic templates | Enhanced templates with traceability | Better planning and accountability |
| **Compliance** | Referenced but unstructured | Formal GDPR/HIPAA modules | Actionable regulatory integration |
| **CI/CD** | Basic validation | Framework compliance checks | Automatic governance enforcement |

## 0.4.x (Pilot Validation)

| Goal | Current State | Target State | Benefit |
|------|--------------|--------------|---------|
| **Real-World Pilots** | No formal pilots | 2 projects (greenfield & brownfield) | Proof of framework effectiveness |
| **Metrics Dashboard** | Not started | Lead-time, defect, compliance KPIs | Quantifiable value for adopters |
| **Slim Documentation** | Theory-heavy | Remove / archive unused sections | Leaner, easier adoption |
| **Case Study Publication** | None | Publish detailed write-ups | Credibility & community learning |

## 1.0.x (Production)

| Goal | Current State | Target State | Benefit |
|------|--------------|--------------|---------|
| **Enterprise** | Individual focus | Enterprise integration patterns | Potential for large organization adoption |
| **Analytics** | No measurement | Governance impact metrics | Framework effectiveness measurements |
| **Certification** | No program | Certified professionals program | Industry recognition and standardization |

## Long-term Vision

| Goal | Description | Benefit |
|------|------------|---------|
| **Agentic AI Integration** | AI agents that operate within the framework | Reduced human intervention while maintaining governance |
| **Framework Evolution** | Self-improving system based on real-world usage | Continuous optimization of delivery practices |
| **Industry Standard** | Recognized methodology for AI-assisted development | Common language for professional AI development |

All updates tracked via versioned scope documents and governed by the framework's own processes.
